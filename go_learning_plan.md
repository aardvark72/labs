## Capstone Project: Distributed Task Queue System

### Project Overview
Build a distributed task queue system similar to Celery (Python) or Sidekiq (Ruby). This project will demonstrate mastery of Go's concurrency, networking, and system design capabilities.

### Core Features to Implement:

1. **Task Queue Server**
   - Accept tasks via REST API
   - Store tasks in persistent storage (Redis/PostgreSQL)
   - Distribute tasks to workers
   - Handle task priorities and scheduling

2. **Worker Nodes**
   - Connect to queue server
   - Process tasks concurrently
   - Handle failures and retries
   - Report status back to server

3. **Web Dashboard**
   - Monitor queue status
   - View task history
   - Manage workers
   - Real-time updates via WebSockets

4. **CLI Tool**
   - Submit tasks
   - Monitor queue status
   - Administrative commands

### Technical Requirements:
- Use goroutines for concurrent processing
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Include comprehensive tests
- Use Docker for deployment
- Implement graceful shutdown
- Add metrics and monitoring

### Project Structure:
```
